    I’m a frontend developer based in Karachi, Pakistan. I specialize in building fast,
responsive, and visually clean one-page websites using React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

I focus on performance, responsiveness, and fast delivery — perfect for startups
and founders who want to launch quickly.

I’m available for freelance work — if you need a landing page or static site, let’s chat!
